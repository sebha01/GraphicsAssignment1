# GraphicsAssignment1
This is the repository for the first assignment for my graphics module where the requirement is to create a 2d scene using GL, this has been put into this repository so I can have version control if anything goes wrong

I have gone for a 2d platformer setting for the scene so that it matches the requirements of the brief which are:
- Scene (2D platformer background)
- Objects (Platforms, collectables, health bars using different rendering modes)
- Use of VBO's and Vertex shaders
- Texture mapping on the objects
- Transparency with blending
- Interactive controls
- Hierarchal modelling (Player character)
- Challenge and solution recording for demo
